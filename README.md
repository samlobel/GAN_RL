# GAN RL
Or so we hope. 

## SETUP
#### Set Up TensorPack
The tough part of this is getting OpenCV working on your computer. Tough, but necessary, because TensorPack is a GREAT starting point.



## Activity Log: 
10/03/2016:
Created repository
Installed tensorpack, ale_python_interface.
Installed atari_roms in tensorpack/tensorpack/dataflow/dataset/atari_rom
Ran DQN.py





## FUTURE NOTES (TO DO:)
I think I may need to set up some infrastructure somewhere to run this. It's WAYYYY 

I may want to use https://github.com/devsisters/DQN-tensorflow/ instead.
Not sure. But it does look promising as well. And I could just modify the simple replay_memory file to work for generative replay as well. Chance ADD to TRAIN, change SAMPLE to GENERATE. Much less complicated, as a program.
No work with Atari Gym unfortunately.
